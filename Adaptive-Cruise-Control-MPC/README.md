# Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) Using Model Predictive Control (MPC)

This project implements an **Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)** system using **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** with the `do-mpc` library. The goal is to ensure safe vehicle following by maintaining a safe distance from the lead vehicle while adhering to a set velocity whenever possible.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Lead Vehicle Simulation**:
   - The lead vehicle's motion is modeled with a sinusoidal acceleration profile, ensuring a realistic and varying behavior.

2. **MPC-based Control**:
   - Formulates the ACC problem as an optimization problem.
   - Controls acceleration (`a_ego`) as the primary input to achieve desired outcomes.

3. **Safety and Performance Objectives**:
   - Maintains a safe distance (`D_safe`) between the ego and lead vehicles.
   - Ensures the ego vehicle follows a set velocity (`v_set`) when safe.

4. **Nonlinear Constraints**:
   - Velocity constraint: The ego vehicle's velocity is bounded above to ensure safety.

5. **Simulation and Visualization**:
   - Plots the ego and lead vehicles' acceleration, velocity, and relative distance over time.
   - Demonstrates the controller's effectiveness in maintaining safe distances.

## How It Works

1. **State Variables**:
   - Ego vehicle: Position (`x_ego`), velocity (`v_ego`).
   - Lead vehicle: Position (`x_lead`), velocity (`v_lead`).

2. **Control Input**:
   - Acceleration of the ego vehicle (`a_ego`).

3. **Constraints**:
   - The actual distance (`D_relative`) must always be greater than or equal to the safe distance (`D_safe`).
   - Upper bound on ego vehicle's velocity (`v_ego` â‰¤ 30 m/s).

4. **Optimization Objective**:
   - Minimize the deviation between `D_relative` and `D_safe`.
   - Minimize control effort (`a_ego`).

5. **Results**:
   - The ego vehicle adjusts its acceleration to maintain safety and follow the lead vehicle efficiently.
   - Demonstrated using time-series plots for acceleration, velocity, and relative distance.

This project is inspired by the principles of vehicle dynamics and control. The curvature previewing and MPC setup are adapted to ensure real-time feasibility and accuracy. This implementation was inspired by a MathWorks example [MathWorks' Adaptive Cruise Control System Using Model Predictive Control](https://de.mathworks.com/help/mpc/ug/adaptive-cruise-control-using-model-predictive-controller.html). The parameters used were adapted from their documentation, but the code and implementation are original
